To start a website, you need a program (Visual Studio Code).

If it is run down with VSC (Visual Studio Code):

    1) open a new terminal: at the top(navbar), click (Terminal -> New Terminal) or combination on the keyboard ( Ctrl + Shift + ` ), 
    then in the terminal you must be in the appropriate folder: ( C:\...\aboutMe), enter in terminal: ( cd .\back\ ), then: (npm i) wait until it updates
    everything, and finally: (npm start);

    2) at the top, open the next terminal: (Terminal -> New Terminal) or combination on the keyboard ( Ctrl + Shift + ` ), then in the terminal you must
    be in the appropriate folder: ( C:\...\aboutMe), enter in terminal: ( cd .\front\ ), then: (npm i) wait until it updates everything, 
    and finally: (npm start). 

    3) Website will automatically open.
